Especialmente o comentário do PragDave:</p><p>Dave: I’d like to predict that the current stacks of software by 10-15 years are going to be in a much worse legacy and more of a nightmare to maintain. You’re going to have employment forever maintaining this stuff. C++, Java code, C# code, this stuff is very complicated and very brittle with all these class libraries and frameworks. We’re digging ourselves in a really big hole and there will be a lifetime of opportunities for you people to maintain this stuff that you’re creating.</p><p>Prepare-se e pense nisso antes de comprar aquela ferramenta mágica ou criar mais um framework que faz a mesma coisa que todos os outros.</p></body></html>
