Venture investors are driven by exit strategies. The reason they were funding all those laughable startups during the late 90s was that they hoped to sell them to gullible retail investors; they hoped to be laughing all the way to the bank. Now that route is closed. Now the default exit strategy is to get bought, and acquirers are less prone to irrational exuberance than IPO investors.</p><p>Even Tim O’Reilly was wearing a suit, a sight so alien I couldn’t even parse it at first. I saw him walk by and said to one of the O’Reilly people “that guy looks just like Tim.”</p><p>“Oh, that’s Tim. He bought a suit.”</p><p>I ran after him, and sure enough, it was. He explained that he’d just bought it in Thailand. </p><p>As you read this, a whole new generation of software is being written to take advantage of Ajax. There hasn’t been such a wave of new applications since microcomputers first appeared. Even Microsoft sees it, but it’s too late for them to do anything more than leak “internal” documents designed to give the impression they’re on top of this new trend.<br> …<br> Their only hope now is to buy all the best Ajax startups before Google does. And even that’s going to be hard, because Google has as big a head start in buying microstartups as it did in search a few years ago. </p><p>I think everyone would agree that democracy and Ajax are elements of “Web 2.0.” I also see a third: not to maltreat users. During the Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high-handed with users.</p><p>E a minha preferida:</p><p>But there is a common thread. Web 2.0 means using the web the way it’s meant to be used. The “trends” we’re seeing now are simply the inherent nature of the web emerging from under the broken models that got imposed on it during the Bubble.</p><p>Eu acho que nunca concordei tanto com o Grahan.</p><p>A Web 2.0 para mim é uma nova tentativa de toranr a Internet algo mais que sites de notícias e conteúdo gratuito, é algo que une o contexto atual em tecnologia, onde a Microsoft não pode matar algo por não colocar no seu brwoser, onde o Google é o que todo mundo tem medo e olha e onde os investidores não compram mais qualquer coisa rpa vender depois.</p><p>Só espero que não prostituam este termo como fizeram com o <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090212105929/http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=open+source+2.0&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=lang_pt&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images">Open Source 2.0</a>.</p></body></html>
